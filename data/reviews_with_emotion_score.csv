Myron Jenping Chiu,389 reviews,GB,"Jul 29, 2024","My sisters and I visited Rolex store…My sisters and I visited Rolex store inside Selfridges on 5th July. We were shocked by the unfriendly attitude from a shop assistant (we did not get his name but for the purpose of identification purpose, he appears to be black while another assistant appears to be of Asian origin who was serving another customer at the time). When he talked to us, we told him that we were looking for a specific model of Rolex. He did not smile at us and he told us to do our research as that Rolex model was not available in the store. He made us feel un-welcome in the store and seemed to look down on us. What kind of customer service was that! Unacceptable! Clearly he may need another training from Rolex or Selfriges.

In case what you mean is: ""Does Rolex use battery-powered Quartz movements?"" the answer is no. They only produce watches that use mechanical calibers powered by springs. There was a time long ago when Rolex produced the Rolex Oyster Quartz which had a battery but they have almost immediately stopped producing this watch. Nowadays, all Rolex watches are mechanical and use either automatic (self-winding) movements or in some cases, a manual wind movement.Date of experience: May 01, 2024",5,-0.08,0.43

Took it to a recognised Rolex repair centre as the watch was purchased 6 years ago (one year outside of the Rolex warranty). The report was that it had sufferd a large knock so had to have a complete service as well as new glass etc - total £780.....I've had my Rolex for 35 years and never had a service and it works perfectly.

Mr Charles de Rohan,1 review,GB,"Apr 5, 2024","Don't ever buy one!Don't ever buy one!I've read a couple of similar experiences here that I have had with my wife's Oyster.It has always run a little fast, and although discussed at each service this has never changed.Then one day it stops, WITHOUT and large knock or similar, and I can hear a rattle inside that is clearly a moving part that has come adrift.To be clear, she's 62 years old and is comparatively sedentary, the watch being worn daily, but always taken off at night and when bathing (even though of course it is waterproof!). Rolex's response is that they will repair, but only at an exorbitant cost. My opinion is that this is the horological equivalent of a ""Friday car"" from the 70's - it has NEVER been accurate, in spite of Rolex's so-called ""Quality Checks""Really disappointed in both the product and the customer service.Date of experience: April 04, 2024",1,0.01,0.47

Pip Williams,18 reviews,NZ,"Updated May 10, 2024","Rolex are sizeist!Rolex are sizeist!! They simply  don't  make  watches  for smaller women. I looked  at  their models so often & in different countries when travelling  & have never seen one with a dial less than 3.6 cm diam. Even looking  in jewellers' shops today this hasn't  changed. My traveling days are over now  but it would have been a good investment  to leave to my daughters. My wrist  is 13.5 cm in circumference  and measures 4 cm across. This hasn't  changed  in the  last 20 years. A Rolex  ladies' watch  would have not  only  looked  ridiculous  but  also  been uncomfortable  to wear.Looking  at their latest  models  it seems  they  have  not  changed  their  ideas Why are they so discriminatory  against  smaller women?I eventually  bought a nice gold Longines  watch (dial 19 mm diameter) which looks nice,  keeps good time, is comfortable  on the wrist- just unfortunately  not such an asset to leave to the family as a Rolex would  have  been.

My millionaire boss received his brand new Rolex Sky-dweller 3 weeks after ordering.

I have tried two authorized dealers and have quickly learned that unless you are willing to spend thousands of pounds on watches (not Rolex) and Jewlery that you just don't want or need. Then you have no chance of purchasing one unless you turn to the grey market and pay over the odds.

Mongo,14 reviews,ES,"Jun 4, 2021","22-years with my DatejustI bought my Datejust in my mid-twenties with money I'd spent years slowly saving. I've since worn it daily and lived in many different countries with it. In 2012-2013, I travelled round the world and wore it in deserts, jungles, beaches, oceans and mountains. The maximum temperature was 49 C (120 F) in Central Australia and lowest around -28 C in Poland. After all that time, it still keeps perfect time (I've never had it serviced) and the crystal has no scratches. The only sign of age is the metal Oyster strap, which has stretched a little and is quite scratched. I've always treated the watch like a tool and swim in it four times a week.

Carl,3 reviews,US,"Mar 3, 2023","Rolex don't care about their customersRolex makes it very difficult to service watches and left me feeling that they are just interested in selling new watches. At first visit to their NYC service center they would not service my watch unless I provided original bracelet. When I made sure the bracelet was delivered to them, they turned it away. Speaking to them afterwards, they asked me to visit their location one more time with the bracelet. It cant be that you have to visit their location 3 times for the privilege of paying almost $1000 to service a watch.

Shu,6 reviews,SG,"Sep 12, 2019","Poor quality materials and flimsy designRolex claims to put every one of their watches through 20 crash tests before launch. Their watches are supposedly able to withstand 5000G and accompany you to the depths of the sea, highest summit, race track, etc etc...I won't repeat it, you can read it from their website.Well, guess what? I have an Oyster Perpetual Datejust only two years old and I accidentally dropped it the other day whilst removing it from my wrist. Dropped about 80cm to the ground. The glass shattered and the mechanism stopped. I understand that apart from changing the glass, the watch will need a full servicing to check for potential shards of glass in the mechanism...So the money you pay obviously doesn't go into research into better quality, resistant glass or state of the art design that would prevent shards entering the system. What are you paying for, then?I am a disappointed customer. Even more disappointed that I don't even know how to contact them about these issues.Date of experience: September 12, 2019",1,-0.01,0.61

All of Rolex's entry level watches are impossible to purchase due to a managed shortage of pieces.

I purchased my Oyster Perpetual whist living and working in the Middle East 44 years ago and it has not been off my wrist during the entire period since. It has withstood, I am embarrassed to admit, total misuse and only once has it had a Rolex service during its entire lifetime - the service only became necessary due to the glass face having become scratched over the years and difficult to read. The watch has had to endure; Scuba diving, desert sand-storms, water skiing, swimming pools, a high speed car write-off, two separate hijackings, rough handling on construction sites and a multitude of other unbefitting happenstances.

Liz Olsen,7 reviews,GB,"Dec 17, 2021","Appalling service experienceAppalling service experienceThis brand is really sneaky about the so-called 'five year warranty.' From what I am learning, they will always find a reason not to cover the servicing or some aspect of the repair. After six weeks of waiting, I was indeed informed my warranty does not cover because there is an outside dent which means the watch has 'been in an accident.' There was no accident, just normal wear, and if that is what renders a Rolex not working after just four years - consider this my last purchase from this brand.Incredibly poor explanation of what is actually wrong with the watch - i.e., none - just a list of things to replace and (non-competitive) prices to do it. The watch is in great shape and it feels really sneaky, to be honest, and disappointing from a supposedly luxury brand. Less than the cost, it's the service and comms, or lack thereof, that really put the nail in a decidedly poor customer experience.Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a brand that cares whatsoever, they are just riding the wave of a long heritage (into the ground).Date of experience: December 17, 2021",1,-0.02,0.48

Experience tells a different story as I have had the privilege of paying substantial service charges every 5 years or so. Upon reflection a Rolex is a poor time keeper but a handsome luxury wrist adornment. Over the years, I have been staggered by Rolex’s arrogance in almost demanding additional service requirements at my expense to maintain the appearance of the brand. The last straw for me was, approaching my last service ( summer 2019) to be told by a reputable local distributor that the the back case needed to be replaced because of damage! I was staggered by this assertion as I wore the watch continuously on my wrist. Furthemore, upon receipt they praised the condition of the watch. Rolex protocol! It was suggested that the watch was sent to Rolex hq for a second opinion. Mistake.! Rolex came back and directed that the watch needed a rebuilt ie crown, winder, bracelet etc etc at approximately half the cost of a new watch!!!

Rolex would repeatedly assure me issue was rectified only for me to go through the extremely irritating and time-wasting process of collecting from their office to then observe later that it clearly wasn't. Now my ""superlative chronometer"" gains around twelve seconds a day and this is the best they can do.

I've now contacted 4 separate  dealers about a purchasing a Rolex Oyster Perpetual for my wife who has worked hard all last year as a front line worker and wanted to treat her to a 'forever' watch. I've left extensive contact details, email, address and telephone number allong with any size watch with any dial colour and guess what? Not one of them has bothered to call or even reply with a no. It's absolutely disgusting service from a so called top brand. I worked for a bigger well known brand for over 10 years and if I once didn't reply to any customer that showed an interest in our brand no matter how small, I would have been hung drawn and quartered if I did it again I would have been out of job. The lack of respect for the average customer is appauling by any standards but for a world wide brand like Rolex is disgusting. I didn't swamp everywhere at the same time I contacted my local dealer 1st then after they didn't respond I started going further afield. I even explained I couldn't visit them due to Covid 19 restrictions but was ready to buy anything! Did that make any difference..nope.. completely wasting my time and efforts. Why do they even put a contact page on their websites? Naming and shaming them won't make a difference, thy obviously don't care didly squat. But they are.

I visited the store in Mayfair. Rung the bell a man with a clipboard walked up and asked, what watch do you want to buy. No hello, no level of customer service. Explained which one I wanted and asked if I could speak to someone about it. The response I got from him was 'there are no watches to sell'. Asked what he meant considering there were several working display watches in the window and I could only presume they have a stock room hence the security. This shocking experience has actually put me of wanting to buy a Rolex. Had better service from a second hand dealer and would rather pay over the odds than give my money directly to the company.

John Williams,2 reviews,GB,"Oct 21, 2022","I wish I could give them a negative scoreI wish I could give them a negative score. I've had my Rolex 36 years. Until this year, it was all fine - serviced a few times, and always happy. This year, I took it into Rolex, St James's, London at the end of July 2022. They took more than £1,000 from me for a number of replacements, etc, with a specified return time of '10-12 weeks'. Today, 21st October 2022, I call them for an update. 'Oh dear', they say. 'We've been calling customers with an update, and you just seem to have been missed. We can't get your watch back to you with the repairs done until June 2023' (yes, really). The supervisor, needless to say, wouldn't talk to me, and left the junior member of staff to absorb any anger that I might have. That isn't how I am, and I wasn't unhappy with the young person I spoke to. I am very unhappy, though, with (a) 'just having been missed' in the alleged update calls programme; the ludicrous extension of the return time for my watch from '10-12 weeks' to 10-12 months; and the unwillingness of the spineless supervisor to actually talk to a customer (this is being written an hour later, and still no call-back). If I ran my organisation this way, I would expect to go broke within a year. The lesson from this is - never again will I say a good word about Rolex.

GES,8 reviews,US,"Oct 21, 2021","What happened, really?I always knew that Rolex doesn't reign supreme, however, it was a watch that intrigued me. Considering the price 1 pays for a watch, the 1 time 5 year warranty comes off as a sick joke. Believe me, Rolex is the only 1 laughing. I took in my watch due to a 2 minute lag & a crunchy/raspy (?) feel to it when I would wind it. I was told that do to covid & high waiting list it would be 3 months wait. I agreed. 3 months later, I received my watch back. Though not with a 2 minute lag but still a lag & the same crunchy/raspy feel. To put the frosting on the crap cake. I had to pay $300 out of pocket for a full polish that for some reason the ""warranty"" does not cover. When I picked up my watch I was asked: ""Would you like to see other Rolex watches for a future addition?"" I replied: ""This was my 1st & last.""

S_U,2 reviews,GB,"Sep 16, 2019","Rolex Submariner failed within warranty periodAfter years of planning for a Rolex, eventually bought a Rolex Submariner Date. This apparently, was meant to be the most durable for everyday wear as advised by the Rolex sales person and my general research. When I first got the watch, I was generally impressed with the engineering of it. I didn’t want a watch to just wear on special occasions and evenings, which was the primary reason I bought the Submariner. Naturally I wore it everyday as per my plan. I started getting scuff markings on the strap pretty much straight away, which I wasn’t too fussed about. I also wore it to play golf, as I have seen many people doing this and didn’t see much reason not too given it was such a premium watch. Also didn’t have any issues with my previous watches. It worked pretty well and kept time well.Less than 3 years after I bought this brand new, started having a vibrating feeling in the watch every time I moved. Just any normal hand gesture, it would vibrate. Given the watch is guaranteed for 5 years, I took it to a Rolex dealer straight away and expected it to be covered for normal wear and tear and serviced under warranty. I now have a bill of £550 as this was deemed not covered under warranty as they found a mark on the watch, which they found caused the internal movement to dislodge. I am very disappointed with this as I have only used it for everyday wear. My advice now is you only buy a Rolex if you want to use it for evenings or special occasions and not as an everyday watch. Which I feel defeats the purpose of spending so much on a watch. Very disappointed that it failed within warranty and wasn't covered!!Date of experience: September 16, 2019",2,0.04,0.55

I went to the Mall and the watch shop that are selling Rolex watches they said they do not sell any watches at the moment. They said they only receive a very small number of watches to sell, however their shop is pristine and looks expensive to run. And this made me think that they can afford to loose all this money because their profit margins is so great. Basically Rolex is a non-profit organisation and they must spend all their profits. Very poor customer service. And also with this attitude they have alienated me from the brand. I think I will buy Omega instead. Or maybe a Tudor. However, Rolex, just a bad taste in my mouth after dealing with them. I also enquired online and received the answer that the watches from Rolex are only for returning customers. How many submariners can one person get? Or maybe they endorse the grey market. I won't buy, period. I won't buy now, when I am just starting to make money, and I won't buy when I will have plenty for a Patek. I just won't buy ever after this, I despise the attitude; they won't sell it to new customers? Why? 1 star to much.

I was served by Mr Ali who gave me one of the worst experiences I ever had in luxury retailers. I understand the model is extremely popular and they don’t have any in stock. However, when I asked to be put on the waiting list Mr.Ali was not willing to help me AT ALL!!!! He basically told me that it’s impossible to get so I shouldn’t waste mine and his time. The watch which I am after costs thousands of pound, if a customer is willing to wait for 6 months to get it, the sales should try their best to help. What’s worst is that I went back to ask for the business card/contact number of Mr.Ali so perhaps if I see something else in the future I can contact him straight away to be able to get it. He refused to give me any details and tell me if I want something in the future, I need to go to the store and see what they have. This is absolutely unacceptable! I have never experienced this kind of service. I am ready to spend thousands of pound and I am expecting an excellent customer service from ROLEX.

I went to the Rolex store at Selfridges last week. The security guard at the door was polite. An elder Asian salesperson who seemed to be in her 70s was standing behind the counter, displaying no intention whatsoever of greeting me, just standing there with a completely blank face and ignoring me. Nevertheless, I approached her to enquire about what I was looking for - a Rolex Date-just 41mm for my husband. Bluntly, I was met with only 2 words: “Not Available!”I tried to enquire when one would be available or what the procedure was to acquire one. To my disbelief, she just said she didn’t know and walked away. I was mortified and embarrassed beyond words! She just showed no interest for what she was doing. And no respect for the customer. I was wondering whether she was even working there? Was it because she couldn’t afford to retire...? However, the least she should do is to discharge her job with a minimum of courtesy and good manners. Or maybe she was afraid I had Covid-19? I do wear my mask at all times and do practice good social distancing. I just concluded that this individual was rude beyond description and definitely a waste of space. Anyway, she reflects very poorly on Rolex. She is an assault on your brand. I have since spoken to my friends and family about my vile experience and all of them were quite shocked to hear it and will probably have second thoughts before considering to purchase a Rolex.

Catherine ,6 reviews,GB,"Nov 19, 2016","Offensive staffs at Knightsbridge branchMe and my husband decided to visit Rolex store on our way to Harrods on Saturday 19th November around 3.20pm as we were looking for a gift for my father. We were excited to visit the store as we had a model in mind that we specifically wanted to purchase. Unexpectedly, when we tried to enter the store the security guard refused to let us in as we were told that we can't enter because the store is very busy. When I had a glance at the store, there were only 3 groups of customers. We were also told that the wait will take about 20 minutes, which we understood as waiting inside the store. However, as we stepped into the store, the security guard quickly pushed the door and told us to wait outside. We felt terribly offended and we had to ask if we can wait inside. Finally, the security guard reluctantly let us in. Even after we were let in the store, the security guard was staring at us with suspicion as if we were there to steal something.Just because we look young and are not best dressed, the security guard has no right to judge us. He assumed  that we are unable to afford the watches and hence he didn't want to let us in. Both my husband and I are young professionals, working at respectable jobs, and are able to afford the watches at Rolex. Due to such offensive behaviour, the excitement we had before was lost. We were so offended that we couldn't stay in the store any longer.Think about how many customers like us get turned away from the store just because of him. Also, think about what damage he caused to the brand's image. He made us re-think about our decision to purchase a Rolex watch. People should never be judged by age or looks.

Citibadger,35 reviews,GB,"Updated Nov 23, 2019","Rolex/Tudor service is a disgrace.I have had the misfortune to have had to contact Rolex customer service on 3 occasions now. My Tudor Black Bay Bronze has an issue with it's leather strap. Being this isn't my daily watch, I wouldn't expect it to begin flaking after a year of wear (not daily). Rolex have failed to understand nor sort the issue. In fact after 3 calls to them, 2 of which they have failed to return my call, I'm thoroughly hacked off. The customer 'service' is absolutely shocking/non existent.  Maybe Rolex don't care about the riff raff Tudor watch owners, treating them as 2nd class citizens, compared to 'proper' Rolex owners. I'm genuinely shocked at how bad the after sales service is. Their total lack of care is disappointing and unforgivable. I will tomorrow be making my 4th attempt to get this matter dealt with. If I do not get the matter resolved tomorrow, I will be personally visiting Rolex head office and not leaving until the matter is resolved to my satisfaction. Be assured that I will be telling anyone and everyone just how poor the service has been, absolutely shocking. Rolex/Tudor, you are a disgrace.The elitist impression that Rolex/Tudor want to project is truly unfounded. You only really know the quality of a company when you have a problem or issue. Now I have unfortunately had to experience Rolex after sales, I can say that Rolex are shocking. Their after sales service is sloppy and truly abysmal, with a complete lack of interest and refusal to accept there could be an issue with one of their 'elite' products.  Preferring instead to blame the owner first without even examining their product!! I have a number of other quality watches (Omega, Tag) and never had an issue with them. Rolex's insistence that they need the entire watch back when there is no issue with the actual watch, but 'that's just our policy' is bizarre as they need the watch as a reference to book any repairs?!I have a Casio G Shock which was looked at by Casio, unbelievable service that was fairly priced and very efficient. Rolex/Tudor could learn a lot from them.Date of experience: October 31, 2019",1,-0.16,0.51

Andrew,1 review,GB,"Sep 13, 2023","Rolex buying system sucksI would like to say I was writing a review about a Cellini but I willNever own one, this really is regarding the service in the Rolex AD, I wanted to purchase a white gold circa 20k Cellini but was so put off by the Rolex buying system ( no guarantees of a purchase only a waiting list with no specified duration and feeling like I was being sized up for whether I was good enough to buy one) that I bought a very fine and far superior in my view, Patek Philippe Calatrava in white gold for 5k less and with immediate delivery. So Rolex, sort yourself out, your system to manage supply and demand and to alienate customers has the opposite effect on some people and only drives them into the grey market where your brand is being tarnished by unscrupulous resellers.Date of experience: September 01, 2023",1,0.19,0.5

J W,2 reviews,GB,"Feb 15, 2023","Tried to buy a rolex for my sons…Tried to buy a rolex for my sons birthday through WOS brighton. i had some buying history through them, inc a tudor and a rolex for my wife.I should say that i have been wearing my rolex for over 30 years. its the only watch i have worn during that time.I discussed the item i wanted to buy (SS Sub). i asked if it would be possible. i gave the date it would be needed by and gave 16 months notice that i needed.i was told that they couldnt make any promises, but with my buying history and giving them so much notice, it should be possible.Bday came around - watch didnt materialise. I was not happy. AD advised that they didnt have any stockI asked how many SS Subs they had had in the last 12 months. refused to answer. a lack of supply is used as an excuse, nothing more.3 days later, i walked past a watch reseller shop - literally 5 mins walk from the AD.They had the exact watch that i was looking for, i asked to take a look. it  was sold by the same AD two weeks earlier and had miraculously appeared in a reseller shop around the corner. had the purchaser changed their mind?? im being sarcasticThe problem is not a lack of supply, the problem is with selling the watches to same people over and over again, who have no real interest of enjoying or wearing the watch at all.Later i found out that a member of the team had been sacked for selling watches out of the back door a few months earlier - in exchange for 'payments'.Personally, i think someone should go through every single sports model sold from that branch and see how many times the same watch was sold to the same person over a 5 year period.... i think it would be enlightening. Rolex can point their finger at the AD - but they make the rules for the AD. i think its time to scrap the AD scheme altogether and just sell direct - rather than supporting ADs who are on the make and on the take.the current cost of living crisis and slowing of demand might actually help - perversely, if the resell market slows, these scumbag resellers will stop buying and the ADs will be able to clearly see who they are. the problem is, of course, its probably their mates....Date of experience: January 15, 2023",1,0.07,0.35

Mr. A,1 review,DK,"Updated Apr 26, 2021","Benefits, disadvantages, discrimination, blackmail, beauty and joy.Let me start by saying I absolutely adore, my black sub date 40 mm!I’m an ordinary guy, who stopped wearing a watch at the age of 15, because I started dreaming, of a “time piece”, as I call quality automatic life time watches.  I did NOT fall for Rolex, due to being a “I made it in life” brand! If you bother studying the watch world, it quickly becomes apparent, that many watch collectors find Rolex “common”, it’s one of the lowest ranking luxury intro level watches, with only TAG and OMEGA being cheaper. For many it’s brands like AP or Patek Philippe starts the “I really made it in life”.I knew that I would be a one watch man, and spent the next 25 years, investigating, studding, reading about, looking at, trying on and comparing “time pieces” and it became very clear, that the classic submariner, was the only watch, that for filled the criteria, classic, timeless, simple, sporty yet elegant, sturdy, historic and beautiful.By the time I had established which “time piece” I wanted, it became only too apparent, that it was an uphill struggle, even in a city like London, it was impossible to find.Over time it only got harder, the AD’s all over the world, started “blackmailing” me. As many others report, I was asked to buy unwanted jewellery or unpopular bi gold Rolex watches, to be even considered, as a possible future sub owner, yet without any guarantee, which is shocking and boarder line illegal and something I refused to be bullied into.As others reviews also report, MANY of the AD’s around the world, are a disgrace.No wonder other brands like AP chose to stop using corrupt AD’s and taking the sales into their own hands, Rolex should consider to do the same, to insure quality customer experience and avoid their AD’s feeding the grey and black market directly.The surprise of my life came, when my partner, had luck on his side and only weeks before my 40th birthday, found a small, honest and helpful AD in La Rochelle France, who sold him my dream watch, brand new, at list price without snobby attitude or illegal demands, thank you “Alain”, nice to see honesty still exists!Unfortunately the Rolex created production/demand “shortfall”, is not just a downside, to those unsuccessfully wishing to buy a Rolex, but also endangers us as owners.Unfortunately being the owner of a Rolex watch, also means one is targeted by criminals, not just in the streets but even by professional gangs, studying guests at upmarket hotels, restaurants, bars and clubs, all around the world, due to the insane grey and black market demand and sky high prices, the watches achieve, no questions asked, Rolex actually adds unnecessary endangerment to the life and health of their clients, which really isn’t ok. I have a friend, who was rubbed after leaving a high profiled cocktail bar, in a very violently way, even without doing any attempt, to fight back, so that is another thing, you have to be aware of, when thinking of buying and wearing a Rolex.Another friend is likewise dreaming, of owning the sub, willing to run the above risks, yet like many other reviewers report, also the AD’s in Copenhagen, snob none celebrity potential clients, try to blackmail, them into buying piles of unsellable watches or unwanted jewellery, only for the AD then to consider, maybe to let you join a never ending waiting list with absolutely no guarantee of ever owning the wanted watch. It’s not just Rolex who select and discriminate amongst their clients, HERMÈS does it too with bags like the birkin or the Kelly, you having the money doesn’t mean you get to buy what you want, you might be offered a less attractive product or simply none at all. Rolex clearly do not care, neither about the many potential clients ready to buy, nor the safety of current Rolex owners, on their way trying, to achieve iconic luxury recognition like AP or Patek Philippe. I hope one day, anybody who can afford the brand will be able to buy into it, achieve the joy ad happiness I explore every day and at the same time, stop putting the owners into danger.I love my sub, its beauty and craftsmanship, fills me with joy every single day, I’m grateful to have been gifted it, I’m proud my long time dream has come true, but at times the need to plan when and where i wear my “time piece”, sprinkles a Grey shadow over the joy.Date of experience: April 26, 2021",4,0.08,0.52
